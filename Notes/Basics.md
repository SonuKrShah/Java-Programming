# Introduction

Java is a object oriented, secured, platform independent general purpose programming language.

## Principle of Java

Write Once and Run Anywhere.

This means that Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

* Java applications are typically converted into byte-code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine(JVM) regardless of the underlying operating system.

## Different Editions of Java

* Java Platform, Standard Edition
* Java Platform, Enterprise Edition
* Java Platform, Micro Edition
* JavaFX

## Uses of Java

* Banking - transaction management
* Mobile Application Development - Android
* Desktop Applications - AWT, Swing, JavaFX
* Big Data - Hadoop
* Web Applications - Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate

## JRE, JDK and JVM

* JDK : Java Development Kit - provides an environment to develop and execute the java program.
* JRE : Java Runtime Environment -	provides an environment to only run java programs onto your machine. JRE consists of libraries and other files that JVM uses at runtime.
* JVM :	Java Virtual Machine - It is an abstract computing machine that is responsible for executing the java program line by line.
